Concrete is a lightweight framework for Shopify. It has everything you need, plus some goodies you won't want to live without. We have tried to keep Concrete as lightweight as possible so it doesn't impose styling choices upon you that take a lot of time to overwrite. Concrete's CSS framework gives you a lovely grid to work with, some CSS resets to make your theme consistent across as many browsers as possible. It also defines some common variables and provides some SCSS mixins that will make development faster.

Developers using Slate will be happy to see that all of the CSS and JavaScript has been separated into modular chunks, so you can easily extend Concrete without modifying the core of the framework.

### MIT License

We have put a lot of time and effort into Concrete and we will be continuing to do so. The Concrete framework is available under an MIT license which means you can do whatever you like to it, as long as you maintain the original license and **leave all credits and their original location**.
