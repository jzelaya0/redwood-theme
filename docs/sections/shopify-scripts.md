# Shopify Scripts

This starter theme includes a collection of utility libraries meant for developers to build custom components. A great example of using one of these libraries would be using `@shopify/theme-cart` to interact with the Shopify Cart API. For more information and documentation on these libraries visit the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-scripts).
